# Skylines

Skylines is a site that generates random city names and skylines. The building
windows randomly change between grayscale colors, and the sun/moon toggles day
and night modes.

### Input

City names were taken from Wikipedia's [List of national capitals][1] article,
released under the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 3.0][2].

### Implementation

Names are generated using the [namerator][3] module. Skylines are generated by
creating SVG elements for a random number of buildings (with random dimensions
and placement for each). Local storage is used to apply a previously chosen
day/night mode.

### Bundling

The site's script, `index.js`, is bundled from the TypeScript source in the `ts`
directory using this command:

`deno bundle ts/index.ts index.js`

The `deno.json` file is implicitly required, as it specifies dom-related
libraries to use when bundling.
